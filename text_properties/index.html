    <h1>Rabbit</h1>
    <hr>
    <p>
        Rabbits are small <a href="#nowhere">mammals</a> in the family Leporidae (which also includes the hares), which
        is in the order
        Lagomorpha (which also includes pikas). They are familiar throughout the world as a small herbivore, a prey
        animal, a domesticated form of livestock, and a pet, having a widespread effect on ecologies and cultures. The
        most widespread rabbit genera are Oryctolagus and Sylvilagus. The former, Oryctolagus, includes the European
        rabbit, Oryctolagus cuniculus, which is the ancestor of the hundreds of breeds of domestic rabbit and has been
        introduced on every continent except Antarctica. The latter, Sylvilagus, includes over 13 wild rabbit species,
        among them the cottontails and tapetis. Wild rabbits not included in Oryctolagus and Sylvilagus include several
        species of limited distribution, including the pygmy rabbit, volcano rabbit, and Sumatran striped rabbit.

    <h2>Taxonomy and evolution</h2>
    <hr>
    <p>Rabbits and hares were formerly classified in the order Rodentia (rodents) until 1912, when they were moved into
        the order Lagomorpha (which also includes pikas). Since 1945, there has been support for the clade Glires that
        includes both rodents and lagomorphs,[13] though the two groups have always been closely associated in taxonomy;
        fossil,[14] DNA,[15] and retrotransposon[16] studies in the 2000s have solidified support for the clade. Studies
        in paleontology and molecular biology suggest that rodents and lagomorphs diverged at the start of the Tertiary
        period.[17]</p>
    <p>
        The extant species of family Leporidae, of which there are more than 70, are contained within 11 genera, one of
        which is Lepus, the hares. There are 32 extant species within Lepus. The cladogram is from Matthee et al., 2004,
        based on nuclear and mitochondrial gene analysis.[18]
